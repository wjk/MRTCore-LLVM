# MRT Core compiled with Clang

This repository contains a copy of [the flat C MRT Core API](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/tree/main/dev/MRTCore/mrt),
patched to successfully compile with Clang 21.1.2. I have tested it with [LLVM-MinGW version 20250924](https://github.com/mstorsjo/llvm-mingw/releases/tag/20250924)
on macOS 15.6.1 and on Windows 11 for both x64 and ARM64 architectures.
